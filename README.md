# Data Science Assignments 

## BigDat Assignments

BigDat focused on statistical methods within R to address the more mathematical side of data science. The final assignment flipped back to Python to show how we can do the same methods in different languages, while also learning about the keras module in depth to address how we can visualise how accurately a model fits. 

## CompSci Project - Book Recommendation Project:

The CompSci Project used Cosine Similarity to implement machine learning algorithms on gathered data points to return book recommendations based on user preferences. Created with Python and using the Pandas, Beautiful-Soup, LXML, AST and SK.learn libraries. 

## DatInd Assignment 1

This assignment focused on exploratory data analysis within an R-Shiny environment, and encouraged us to write about common and outlying occurrences in data.

## DatInd Assignment 2

The second assignment expanded our understanding of EDA with a larger dataset. Further development of the code allowed the development of new graphs to better suit the new data.

## DatInd Assignment 3

Assignment 3 focused on finding the best performing regression model. This encouraged exploration and confidence in using and creating the different regression models available. The R-Shiny app was further developed to include new and improved features to better display our understanding.

## DatInd Assignment 4

Assignment 4 tested my ability to transfer between machine learning 'frameworks' and my overall understanding of r-markdown and control charts in relation to data.

## DatM Assignments

Data Management focused on SQL and our ability to write queries to create appropriate tables. This was further expanded in our second assignment with writing complex queries.

## DatMin Assignments

DatMin is a course in statistical learning and data mining. I was introduced to techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning problems, these methods included but were not limited to classification, regression, clustering and association purposes that were introduced such as decision trees, random forests, Apriori algorithm and support vector machines. R was the programming language utilised within these assignments. 

## ScalDat Assignment 1

Code included is using Apache Spark and Hadoop and focuses on cleaning and processing data to display specific results.

Dataset is the Global Historical Climatology Network daily.

## ScalDat Assignment 2

Code included expands the knowledge of assignment 1 using a different dataset, Million Song Dataset. Data cleaning and processing is done in part 1 to provide knowledge for the further analysis in part2.
