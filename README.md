## COSC480 Project - Book Recommendation Project:

Code included is for my final computer science assignment, using python and many python libraries. 

It sources data from the goodbooks-10k data set and uses multiple functions to clean the data and gather the required fields to provide usable output.

## DATA420 Assignment 1

Code included is using Apache Spark and focuses on cleaning and processing data to display specific results.

Dataset is the Global Historical Climatology Network daily.

## DATA420 Assignment 2

Code included expands the knowledge of assignment 1 using a different dataset, Million Song Dataset. Data cleaning and processing is done in aprt 1 to provide knowledge for the further analysis in part2.

## DATA423 Assignment 1

This assignment focused on exploratory data analysis within an R-Shiny environment, and encouraged us to write about common and outlying occurences in data.

## DATA423 Assignment 2

The second assignment expanded our understanding of EDA with a larger dataset. Further development of the code allowed the development of new graphs to better suit the new data.

## DATA423 Assignment 3

Assignment 3 focused on finding the best performing regression model. This encouraged exploration and confidence in using and creating the different regression models available. The R-Shiny app was further developed to include new and improved features to better display our understanding.

## DATA423 Assignment 4

Assignment 4 tested my ability to transfer between machine learning 'frameworks' and my overall understand of r-markdown and control charts in relation to data.

## MBIS623 Assignments

MBIS focused on SQL and our ability to write queries to create appropriate tables. This was further expanded in our second assignment with writing complex queries.

## STAT462 Assignments

STAT462 is a course in statistical learning and data mining. I was introduced to techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning problems, these methods included but were not limited to classifciation, regression, clustering and association purposes that were introduced such as decision trees, random forests, Apriori algorithm and support vector machines. R was the programming language utilised within these assignemnts. 

## STAT448 Assignments

STAT448 focused on statistical methods within R to address the more mathematical side of data science. The final assignment flipped back to Python to show how we can do the same methods in different languages, while also learning about the keras module in depth to address how we can visualise how accurately a model fits.
